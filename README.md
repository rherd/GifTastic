# GifTastic

This app is built using html, css and bootstrap, javascript and jquery, and an api key + call. The purpose of the page is to give the user a pre-set group of buttons for generating gifs on the page. The gifs are pulled from Giphy using their API, and 10 results are displayed, along with the ratings. I used bootstrap rows/columns to display the submit form and the Gif results. The user can add new categories of buttons on top of the displayed buttons. Clicking on a button displays the Gifs, and clicking on the image will either animate (if still) or pause (if animated) the selected gif. 

This was done week 6 of GT Coding BootCamp.
